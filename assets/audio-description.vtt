I've been talking a lot about
web accessibility already.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.500
It makes sense for me to actually
explain or give you a definition

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.170
of what web accessibility is.

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.379
Web accessibility means that every
single person, including those

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.070
with disability can navigate.

00:00:16.544 --> 00:00:21.665
Perceive, understand, and use
websites, tools, and services

00:00:21.685 --> 00:00:24.005
online without any difficulty.

00:00:26.185 --> 00:00:29.274
Now that we've covered what web
accessibility means, I'd like to

00:00:29.274 --> 00:00:34.374
introduce you to a concept called the
WCAG guidelines or the WCAG principles.

00:00:34.664 --> 00:00:37.285
WCAG is a set of guidelines.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.480
That are guiding the building of
accessible websites on the web.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.290
So your guide guidelines that you should
follow when you are considering building

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.320
or when you are thinking of building
your, , making your sites more accessible.
